## Nigerian Startup Launches Custom Dining App to Help Diabetics Find Safe Restaurant Options

**New mobile app addresses critical need for diabetes-friendly dining in Nigeria's growing restaurant industry**

**Nigeria** - December 26, 2024 - Custom Dining, a groundbreaking mobile application designed specifically for Nigerians with dietary restrictions, has officially launched its website and will soon release its mobile app to help the country's estimated 5+ million diabetics safely navigate restaurant dining.

### Addressing a Critical Health Challenge

With Nigeria having one of Africa's highest diabetes rates, dining out has become a significant challenge for millions of citizens. Traditional Nigerian cuisine, while rich and flavorful, often contains hidden sugars and high-carbohydrate ingredients that can be dangerous for people managing diabetes.

"We realized that people with diabetes in Nigeria were essentially excluded from the social experience of dining out," said [Founder Name], CEO of Custom Dining. "Our platform bridges this gap by providing verified nutritional information and connecting health-conscious diners with restaurants that cater to their needs."

### Key Features and Impact

Custom Dining offers several innovative features:

- **Verified Nutritional Data**: All meal information reviewed by registered dietitians
- **Smart Filtering**: Search restaurants by sugar content, carbs, calories, and specific ingredients
- **Local Integration**: Partnerships with restaurants across Nigerian cities including Lagos, Abuja, Kano, and Port Harcourt
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions based on individual health goals
- **Real-time Updates**: Current menu availability and restaurant information

### Market Opportunity

The Nigerian restaurant industry has grown significantly, with increasing urbanization and dining-out culture. However, health-conscious options remain limited, creating a substantial market opportunity for specialized services like Custom Dining.

### Future Plans

Custom Dining plans to expand its restaurant network across all 36 Nigerian states and integrate with healthcare providers to offer comprehensive diabetes management support.

### About Custom Dining

Custom Dining is a Nigerian health-tech startup focused on making dining accessible for people with dietary restrictions. The company's mission is to ensure that health conditions don't prevent anyone from enjoying Nigeria's vibrant food culture.
